#### What is it?

This is a 4x4 BLE Keyboard/keypad/macropad kit for you to build a wireless macropad.  All you need are 16 mechanical switches and keycaps and about an hour for assembly.  


#### What makes it special?

The Macropad uses the Ebyte E73-2G4M04S1B module which contains a nRF52832 and has a CH340 serial chip on board.  It's been designed to be firmware compatible with the Adafruit Feather nRF52832.  As such, you can program it using a simple Arduino program.  If you want a more fully featured programmable keyboard firmware, you can use the BlueMicro_BLE firmware.

As far as I know, this is the only wireless macropad kit you can build and program yourself!
It does support mechanical switches:

* Cherry MX Switches
* Kailh Low Profile Choc Switches


#### Notes

* This is a solder-in kit and does not support hot-swap sockets for switches.
* This is a DIY keyboard kit which requires assembly and additional parts (switches and keycaps).
* The nRF52832 module has been flashed with the Adafruit_nrf52_bootloader and with a test firmware to make sure that it works properly.
