#### What is it?
This is a custom programmable mechanical keyboard with a keyboard layout that uses staggered keys. It uses mechanical switches (Standard Cherry MX type). The keys are hot-swap socketed and have an individual underglow RGB LED which can be turned on.

Since this is a Hot Swappable Switches keyboard, you can choose the MX switches as well as the keycaps you prefer. You can even mix and match switches for the ultimate customization.

#### Why did you make it?
This is a fully programmable keyboard which doesn't require any tooling or special software to change its programming! It's also supported by KMK.

#### Features
* Powered by the Raspberry Pi RP2040 Microcontroller
* Per key RGB LEDs (NeoPixels)
* Kailh hot-swap switch sockets (for MX Switches)
* Included buzzer for audio feedback


#### About the RP2040
The RP2040 microcontroller is a dual core ARM Cortex M0+ running at up to 133Mhz. It bundles in 264kB of SRAM, 30 multifunction GPIO pins (including a four channel 12-bit ADC), a heap of standard peripherals (I2C, SPI, UART, PWM, clocks, etc), and USB support.

#### What's included?

* 1 OffsetMX43 PCB
* 43 RGB LEDs  (SK6812 MINI-E)
* 43 Kailh hot swap Socket for MX Switches
* 1 Controller PCB
* 1 Bottom Plate
* 4 Flex Cable connectors
* 2 Flex cables
* 3 2u Stabilizer
* Standoffs and Screws

#### Notes:

* Standard order does not come with switches or keycaps. You will need to obtain these yourself.
* Switches must be installed with the PCB on a flat surface, so as to not damage the hot swap sockets. Pushing the switches in while holding the PCB in midair may cause the hot swap sockets to come off.
